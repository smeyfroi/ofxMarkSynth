## PROJECT STATUS:

- MarkSynth is a proof of concept that must remain functional for upcoming live performances
- Next steps are:
  - to tune the Mod parameters, Intent settings, and auto response so that visuals do not become chaotic
  - to expand the expressive potential of each Mod
  - to migrate from ofxGui to imgui to enhance the functionality available in the UI
  - to allow saving of a Mod params to rapid load
  - to build a number of MarkSynth configurations from different Mods and connections
  - to convert the ofxParticleSet addon into a GPU-based implementation
